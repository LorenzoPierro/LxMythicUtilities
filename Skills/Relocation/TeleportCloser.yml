# Use this skill to teleport the caster closer to the inherited location, with a specified distance.
# The "resolution" of the metaskill is 0.25 blocks, so a distance that is not a multiple of this value will be rounded to be one. Keep this in mind.
#
# Required Parameters:
# - distance --> How closer the caster should be to the targeted location after the metaskill is executed. Defaults to 1.
#
# Example:
# - skill:Utility_TeleportCloser{distance=2} @EIR{r=10;limit=1;sort=RANDOM}
