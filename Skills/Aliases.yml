# If you do not want to write the complete name of the skill every time you need to use it, you can add to this file (or where you want to, really) something like the following
#
# AliasSkillName:
#   Skills:
#    - skill:OriginalSkillName
#
# So you can now use "AliasSkillName" to execute "OriginalSkillName".
