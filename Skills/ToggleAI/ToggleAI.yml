# The following skills can be used to switch on and off the ai of a mob, with different modes depending on the skill used.
#
# While they are not complex, they should be useful in saving a bit of time and to be used directly via a meg scripted keyframe
#
#
# Description of the skills:
# - Utility_ToggleAI_On --> once used, the ai of the mob is enabled
# - Utility_ToggleAI_Off --> once used, the ai of the mob is turned off
# - Utility_ToggleAI --> once used with a `d` parameter, turns off the ai of the mob and reenables it after d ticks have elapsed
# - Utility_ToggleAI_Force --> same usage as ToggleAI, but the AI of the mob will be forced to be off for the duration of the skill
