# ATTENTION:
# With MM version 5.6.2 allowing to use a value of 0 for the repeatInterval universal attribute, this metaskill has lost most of its uses.
# Still, if for whatever reason the repeatInterval does not work for you for whatever reason, this might still be worth a shot
#
#
# Allows to repeat a skill a determined amount of times during a single tick.
# Resonates quite nicely with the repeat and repeatInterval general attributes, allowing to execute a skill multiple times per tick for multiple ticks
#
# Parameters:
#  - repeatskill: the skill to execute
#  - i: the amount of times to execute it
#
# Example Usage:
# - skill:Utility_Skill_Repeat{repeatskill=ExampleSkill;i=10}
# - skill:Utility_Skill_Repeat{repeatskill=ExampleSkill;i=10;repeat=4;repeatInterval=10}
