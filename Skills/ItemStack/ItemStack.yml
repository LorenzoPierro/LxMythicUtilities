# The metaskills in this page can be used to modify the itemstack of a dropped item entity, once it becomes the inherited target
# Those mechanics are to be cast with a item entity targeter, such as ItemsInRadius
# The following commands must be used before implementing the skills:
# /scoreboard objectives add utilityitemstack dummy
# /scoreboard players set global utilityitemstack 1
#
# Example:
# - skill:Utility_ChangeItemStack{amount=2;operation=/} @IIR{r=10}

# This skill is used to increase by 1 the amount of items of the dropped item entity
Utility_IncreaseItemStack:
  Skills:
  - command{c="scoreboard players set global utilityitemstack 1"} 
  - command{c="execute as <target.uuid> store result score @s utilityitemstack run data get entity @s Item.Count"}
  - command{c="scoreboard players operation <target.uuid> utilityitemstack += global utilityitemstack"}
  - command{c="execute as <target.uuid> store result entity @s Item.Count int 1 run scoreboard players get @s utilityitemstack"}

# This skill is used to decrease by 1 the amount of items of the dropped item entity
Utility_DecreaseItemStack:
  Skills:
  - command{c="scoreboard players set global utilityitemstack 1"}
  - command{c="execute as <target.uuid> store result score @s utilityitemstack run data get entity @s Item.Count"}
  - command{c="scoreboard players operation <target.uuid> utilityitemstack -= global utilityitemstack"}
  - command{c="execute as <target.uuid> store result entity @s Item.Count int 1 run scoreboard players get @s utilityitemstack"}

# This skill is used to change the amount of items of the dropped item entity. The amount and the operation can be specified.
#
# Required Parameters:
# - amount --> the amount of the operation. Defaults to 1
# - operation --> the type of operation. Defaults to +. Can be + - * / %
